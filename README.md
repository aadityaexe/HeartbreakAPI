# 💔 HeartbreakAPI

An expressive, dramatic mock API built with Express.js — made for those moments when you just *had* to say something... but she never felt the same. Designed with heartbreak in mind, this API always replies with a cold, coded rejection.

---

## 🧠 What is this?

**HeartbreakAPI** is a playful, emotional, and slightly painful Node.js project. You "confess" your feelings to an endpoint, and it responds the way reality often does — not how you hoped.

Use it to test API routes, build emotional resilience, or add humor to your portfolio.
